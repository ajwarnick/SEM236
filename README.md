## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will provide students with an opportunity to investigate the concepts and practices of various time-based media arts. This will involve an introduction to art- making as a process involving transactions between people, objects, technologies and sites. Lectures focus on a range of contemporary artists and consider characteristics of recent production including simultaneity, immersion, duration, a collapsing of the distinction between art and life, and a realignment of the relationship between audience and artwork. A fundamental introduction to the processes of video art, sound art, and media installation will be explored through a series of workshops and will serve as the basis for the production of several projects. Assignments will be grounded in the development of media literacy, media ethics, dissemination techniques, and teamwork.

## COURSE GOALS AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Students will gain exposure to the intricacies of utilizing and integrating digital technologies in fine art practices. Students will become literate in the history and theory associated with artists experimenting with digital and analogue media. Students will advance their skills with the software used to produce projects, including the Adobe Creative Suite, Google SketchUp, Ableton Live, Javascript, and Processing. Students will manage complex processes and projects, understanding and mastering complicated digital file management and workflows. Students will use a multidisciplinary approach to subject and content of a given project. Students will establish a pattern of self-learning and troubleshooting electronic and digital technology. Students will utilize team structures and collaboration to develop projects of larger scope. Students will master basic use of video sequencing, sound sequencing, 3D modeling, and web media.
